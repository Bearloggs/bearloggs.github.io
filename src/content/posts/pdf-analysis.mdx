# PDF Analysis

## Understanding the PDF Threat Landscape

PDF files have evolved into a sophisticated attack vector for cybercriminals. The format's ubiquity, complexity, and support for interactive features create an attractive environment for attackers.

### Malicious JavaScript Execution

PDF files can contain embedded JavaScript that executes automatically when the document is opened. This capability is legitimately used for form validation, calculations, and interactive elements. However, attackers leverage this functionality to:

- Execute shellcode directly in memory
- Download additional payloads from remote servers
- Exploit vulnerabilities in the PDF reader's JavaScript engine

### Embedded Malware and Droppers

PDF specifications allow for embedding various file formats within documents, including:

- Executable files (.exe, .dll)
- Scripts (.js, .vbs, .ps1)
- Other document formats (.doc, .xls)

These embedded files can be extracted and executed through JavaScript functions or when a user interacts with an embedded object. This technique often bypasses perimeter defenses that might otherwise block executable files.

### Social Engineering in PDF Attacks

Attackers frequently use well-crafted social engineering tactics in malicious PDFs:

- Impersonating trusted entities like banks, government agencies, or vendors
- Creating falsified invoices with modified payment details
- Using urgent language to prompt immediate action
- Including convincing branding and formatting

### Manipulated Business Documents

Invoice fraud represents a particularly lucrative attack vector. As highlighted in the CIRCL course, attackers often:

- Modify legitimate invoices to change payment information
- Create entirely fraudulent invoices that appear legitimate
- Alter document details while preserving official-looking formatting
- Insert manipulated signature images for apparent authenticity

## Step-by-Step PDF Analysis Methodology

### 1. Initial Assessment and File Handling

Before beginning detailed analysis, proper handling and basic assessment are crucial.

**Calculate and document file hashes**:

```bash
# Generate MD5 hash
md5sum suspicious.pdf

# Generate SHA-256 hash
sha256sum suspicious.pdf
```

**Identify the file type and validate the format**:

```bash
# Validate file type
file suspicious.pdf

# Examine header bytes
head -c 20 suspicious.pdf
```

**Check file size for anomalies**:

```bash
# Get file size
ls -la suspicious.pdf
```

**Make a working copy to preserve the original**:

```bash
# Create a working copy
cp suspicious.pdf working_copy.pdf
```

### 2. Metadata Extraction and Analysis

PDF metadata provides valuable context about the document's creation and modifications.

**Extract basic metadata**:

```bash
# Using exiftool
exiftool suspicious.pdf

# Using pdfinfo
pdfinfo suspicious.pdf
```

**Look for discrepancies in timestamps**:

```bash
# Extract creation and modification dates
pdfinfo -meta suspicious.pdf | grep -E 'CreationDate|ModDate'
```

**Identify creator applications and modification tools**:

```bash
# Extract creator and producer information
pdfinfo suspicious.pdf | grep -E 'Creator|Producer'
```

During this phase, document any inconsistencies such as:

- Creation dates newer than modification dates
- Creation tools that don't match the document's purported source
- Metadata that has been stripped completely (may indicate deliberate sanitization)

### 3. Basic Structural Analysis

Analyzing the PDF structure provides insights into potential malicious components.

**Get an overview of PDF components with pdfid**:

```bash
# Basic PDF structure analysis
pdfid.py suspicious.pdf
```

Key indicators to watch for in the pdfid output:

- Presence of /JavaScript objects
- /OpenAction or /AA (Additional Actions) dictionaries
- /Launch actions that might execute code
- /URI actions that could contact remote servers
- /EmbeddedFile entries that might contain malware
- /AcroForm elements that could contain malicious scripts

**Count and verify objects in the PDF**:

```bash
# Count objects using grep
strings suspicious.pdf | grep -c "obj"
strings suspicious.pdf | grep -c "endobj"

# Count stream objects
strings suspicious.pdf | grep -c "stream"
strings suspicious.pdf | grep -c "endstream"
```

Unequal counts of opening and closing tags can indicate corrupted or maliciously crafted files.

### 4. Deep Structural Analysis

After basic assessment, a deeper examination of the document structure is necessary.

**Analyze the PDF structure with pdf-parser**:

```bash
# List all objects
pdf-parser.py suspicious.pdf

# Examine the document catalog
pdf-parser.py -o 1 suspicious.pdf

# Find all references to specific elements
pdf-parser.py -s /JavaScript suspicious.pdf
pdf-parser.py -s /OpenAction suspicious.pdf
pdf-parser.py -s /AA suspicious.pdf
pdf-parser.py -s /Launch suspicious.pdf
pdf-parser.py -s /URI suspicious.pdf
pdf-parser.py -s /EmbeddedFile suspicious.pdf
pdf-parser.py -s /AcroForm suspicious.pdf
```

**Examine objects with references to other objects**:

```bash
# Find objects that reference object 5
pdf-parser.py -r 5 suspicious.pdf
```

**Analyze automatic actions**:

```bash
# Look for document opening actions
pdf-parser.py -s /OpenAction suspicious.pdf

# Examine additional actions
pdf-parser.py -s /AA suspicious.pdf
```

During this analysis, pay special attention to:

- Objects containing compressed streams (may hide malicious content)
- Unusual object relationships or reference chains
- Objects containing encoded data (/Filter directives)

### 5. JavaScript Extraction and Analysis

If JavaScript is present in a PDF, it requires thorough examination and deobfuscation.

**Extract JavaScript from the PDF**:

```bash
# Find JavaScript objects
pdf-parser.py -s /JavaScript suspicious.pdf

# Extract JavaScript from a specific object
pdf-parser.py -o [object_number] -f suspicious.pdf > extracted_js.txt
```

**Use tools for JavaScript extraction**:

```bash
# Extract all JavaScript with pdf-parser
pdf-parser.py -a suspicious.pdf | grep -A 50 "/JavaScript" > all_javascript.txt
```

Analyze the JavaScript for:

- `eval()` functions that execute dynamically generated code
- String manipulation that builds commands or shellcode
- Suspicious URLs or domains
- Heap-spray techniques (large repeating string patterns)
- Encoded payload strings (Base64, hex, or custom encoding)

### 6. Extracting and Analyzing Embedded Content

Embedded files and images may contain malicious code or reveal manipulation.

**Extract embedded files**:

```bash
# Identify embedded files
pdf-parser.py -s /EmbeddedFile suspicious.pdf

# Extract embedded file from a specific object
pdf-parser.py -o [object_number] -f -d extracted_file suspicious.pdf
```

**Extract and analyze images**:

```bash
# Find image objects
pdf-parser.py -s /XObject suspicious.pdf

# Extract image from a specific object
pdf-parser.py -o [object_number] -d extracted_image.jpg suspicious.pdf
```

For extracted files:

- Calculate hashes and check against threat intelligence
- Perform separate malware analysis if an executable is found
- Analyze extracted images for signs of manipulation or forgery

### 7. Analyzing Business Document Manipulation

When analyzing potentially manipulated invoices or business documents, focus on the elements most likely to be tampered with.

**Extract and examine text content**:

```bash
# Extract text from the PDF
pdftotext suspicious.pdf extracted_text.txt

# Search for specific patterns like payment details
grep -E "account|payment|bank|transfer" extracted_text.txt
```

**Check for text added in separate objects**:

```bash
# Look for text objects
pdf-parser.py -s "/T(" suspicious.pdf

# Examine font objects that might be added
pdf-parser.py -s /FontFile suspicious.pdf
```

When analyzing business documents, watch for:

- Text objects added after the original document creation
- Payment details that differ in font, positioning, or formatting
- Signature images with different metadata than the document
- Incremental updates that modify critical information

### 8. Stream Decompression and Analysis

PDF streams are often compressed. Decompressing them can reveal hidden content.

**Identify compressed streams**:

```bash
# Find objects with compression filters
pdf-parser.py -s /FlateDecode suspicious.pdf
```

**Decompress and examine stream content**:

```bash
# Decompress stream from a specific object
pdf-parser.py -o [object_number] -f suspicious.pdf > decompressed_stream.txt
```

**Search for specific patterns in decompressed streams**:

```bash
# Look for JavaScript hidden in streams
pdf-parser.py -a suspicious.pdf | grep -A 50 "/JS" > potential_js_in_streams.txt
```

In decompressed streams, look for:

- Obfuscated commands or code fragments
- Encoded binaries or shellcode
- Hidden script elements not identified in earlier analysis
- URLs, IP addresses, or domain names

## Practical Analysis Techniques and Challenges

### Extracting Embedded Objects: Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge: Multi-layer Encoding**

Objects may use multiple encoding layers to hide content:

```bash
# Handle multiple encoding layers
pdf-parser.py -o [object_number] -f suspicious.pdf > encoded.txt
cat encoded.txt | base64 -d > decoded_layer1.bin
cat decoded_layer1.bin | xxd -r -p > decoded_layer2.bin
```

**Challenge: Custom or Uncommon Filters**

Some PDFs use custom or obscure filters:

```bash
# Identify non-standard filters
pdf-parser.py suspicious.pdf | grep -E "/Filter\s*\[" -A 5

# Extract raw data for manual decoding
pdf-parser.py -o [object_number] -d raw_data.bin suspicious.pdf
```

**Solution: Custom-Built Decoders**

For proprietary encodings, it might be necessary to build custom decoders based on observed patterns.

### Analyzing Active Components: Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge: Heavily Obfuscated JavaScript**

JavaScript can be obfuscated through multiple techniques:

```bash
# Progressive deobfuscation approach
# Step 1: Extract and format
pdf-parser.py -o [js_object_number] -f suspicious.pdf > obfuscated.js
js-beautify obfuscated.js > formatted.js

# Step 2: Replace eval with console.log to see execution results
sed 's/eval(/console.log(/g' formatted.js > stage1.js

# Step 3: Execute in controlled environment to see deobfuscated content
node --inspect-brk stage1.js
```

**Challenge: Split JavaScript**

Code may be split across multiple objects:

```bash
# Find all JavaScript fragments
pdf-parser.py -a suspicious.pdf | grep -A 10 "/JS" > all_js_fragments.txt

# Reconstruct by examining object relationships
pdf-parser.py -o [parent_object] suspicious.pdf
```

**Solution: Dynamic Analysis in Sandbox**

When static analysis reaches its limits, dynamic analysis becomes necessary:

```bash
# Run the PDF in a controlled environment
# Note: This would typically use specialized sandbox tools
```

### Dealing with Encryption and Password Protection

**Challenge: Encrypted PDF Content**

Encrypted PDFs require special handling:

```bash
# Identify encryption
pdfid.py suspicious.pdf | grep -E "/Encrypt|/Encrypt "

# Check encryption details
pdf-parser.py -s /Encrypt suspicious.pdf
```

## Conclusion

PDF analysis in digital forensics and incident response requires a methodical approach combining multiple tools and techniques. Starting with basic structural analysis and progressing through detailed examination of document components, analysts can identify both malicious elements and subtle document manipulations.

The complex nature of the PDF format presents various challenges, from obfuscation techniques to format variants and encryption. By understanding these challenges and applying appropriate analytical techniques, investigators can effectively navigate the complexities of PDF analysis in security investigations.

As both attack and defensive technologies evolve, maintaining awareness of emerging PDF-based threats and analysis techniques remains essential for effective digital forensics and incident response.
