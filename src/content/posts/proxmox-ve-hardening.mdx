# Proxmox VE Hardening Guide (Debian, VPN-Only Admin, Custom SSH Port)

> Secure your Proxmox VE for Internet exposure using both OS- and application-level defenses: a random high-numbered SSH port, strict UFW firewalling, WireGuard VPN, and only VPN-based access for admin and SSH.

---

⚠️ **Warning: This Is Not an Exhaustive Security Checklist**

- This guide covers essential steps for securing your server, but **it is not a complete or exhaustive list** of all possible security measures.
- **Your specific environment may require additional precautions.** Review all relevant documentation, stay informed about current vulnerabilities, and regularly update your security practices.
- **Be extremely careful**: Changing firewall, SSH, or VPN settings can lock you out if misconfigured. Always test changes in a separate session and ensure you have a way to recover access (such as console, KVM, or rescue mode) before proceeding.

## **Security is an ongoing process. Stay vigilant and adapt as your setup and the threat landscape evolve.**

## Keep Debian and Proxmox Patched

Stay up to date—for OS security and software bug fixes:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y
sudo apt autoremove -y
```

---

## Create a Non-root Admin User

Use a separate, non-root admin account for remote access/administration:

```bash
sudo adduser adminuser
sudo usermod -aG sudo adminuser
```

> Replace `adminuser` with your username of choice.

**Set up strong SSH keys (on your laptop):**

```bash
ssh-copy-id adminuser@your.server.ip
```

Or manually add your public key to `/home/adminuser/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

> **Test login:**

```bash
ssh adminuser@your.server.ip
```

Before proceeding, **make sure key login for the new user works**!

---

## Harden SSH: Custom High Port, No Root Password Logins

### Choose a Unique, High SSH Port

- Pick an unused, random port between 49152–65535. Check open ports:

```bash
sudo ss -tuln
```

- Suppose you use **54321**.

### Edit SSH Config

`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

```
Port 54321
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
AllowUsers adminuser
MaxAuthTries 3
LoginGraceTime 30
```

**Restart and TEST SSH:**

```bash
sudo systemctl reload ssh
ssh -p 54321 adminuser@your.server.ip
```

_Do not lock yourself out!_

---

## Lock Down the UFW Firewall

**Install UFW and set defaults:**

```bash
sudo apt install ufw -y
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
```

**Allow only your new SSH port** (for initial remote admin):

```bash
sudo ufw allow 54321/tcp
```

You'll further restrict this after VPN is set up.

---

## Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for Proxmox

1. In **Proxmox web UI**:  
   **Datacenter > Users > Select user > Set "2nd Factor" (TOTP).**
2. Pair 2FA (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.) with all admin accounts.

---

## WireGuard VPN — Only Admin Access via VPN

### Install and Configure WireGuard

**a) Install:**

```bash
sudo apt install wireguard -y
```

**b) Generate VPN server keys:**

```bash
umask 077
wg genkey | tee server_private.key | wg pubkey > server_public.key
```

(_Repeat on each client to generate individual keys_)

**c) Configure WireGuard server** (`/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`):

```ini
[Interface]
Address = 10.10.10.1/24
ListenPort = 51820
PrivateKey = (server_private.key contents)

# Add a [Peer] section for each client:
[Peer]
PublicKey = (client_public_key)
AllowedIPs = 10.10.10.2/32
```

**d) Enable IP Forwarding:**

```bash
echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p
```

**e) Start and Enable WireGuard:**

```bash
sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0
```

**f) Client example config:**

```ini
[Interface]
PrivateKey = (client_private)
Address = 10.10.10.2/24

[Peer]
PublicKey = (server_public)
Endpoint = your.server.ip:51820
AllowedIPs = 10.10.10.1/32
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

---

## Restrict Admin Interfaces to VPN Only with UFW

**After VPN is fully connected and tested:**

```bash
sudo ufw allow 51820/udp                                  # Allow VPN
sudo ufw allow from 10.10.10.0/24 to any port 8006        # Proxmox web GUI from VPN only
sudo ufw allow from 10.10.10.0/24 to any port 54321       # SSH from VPN only
sudo ufw deny 8006/tcp                                    # Block GUI from public
sudo ufw deny 54321/tcp                                   # Block SSH from public
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status verbose
```

_Now, only the VPN subnet can access SSH and GUI. VPN is your admin "door."_

## Enable Proxmox Firewall Feature

- In Proxmox web UI:
  - **Datacenter → Firewall → Enable.**
  - Enable on nodes and VMs as needed.
  - Default: **DROP** all, and **explicitly ALLOW only from VPN subnet**.

---

## Monitor, Audit, Respond

- Check system and Proxmox logs regularly:
  ```bash
  sudo journalctl -xe
  sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log
  sudo tail -f /var/log/pveproxy/access.log
  ```
- Install **Fail2Ban** to block brute-force SSH attempts:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install fail2ban
  ```
- Periodically review user accounts, VPN keys, and firewall rules.

---

## Ongoing Security Checklist

- [ ] Debian & Proxmox regularly patched
- [ ] Non-root sudo admin with SSH key only
- [ ] Random high, unused SSH port
- [ ] SSH: root login denied, passwords off
- [ ] UFW: VPN subnet is only way to reach Proxmox GUI/SSH
- [ ] 2FA enforced for admin users
- [ ] WireGuard VPN required for any admin access
- [ ] Proxmox built-in firewall is enabled
- [ ] Fail2Ban and system logging active

---

## How to Manage UFW Firewall Rules

- **Check active rules:**
  ```bash
  sudo ufw status verbose
  ```
- **List rules, numbered (for easy removal):**
  ```bash
  sudo ufw status numbered
  ```
- **Remove by number:**
  ```bash
  sudo ufw delete <number>
  ```
- **Remove by rule:**
  ```bash
  sudo ufw delete allow 51820/udp
  ```

---

## Quick Recap

- All management traffic must traverse your VPN.
- Nothing (SSH, GUI, etc.) is exposed to the public Internet.
- Regularly log in to your VPN with WireGuard before accessing the web GUI or SSH.
- Periodically review firewall rules, update your system, and check your audit logs.
